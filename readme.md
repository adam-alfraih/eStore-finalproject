<!-- # E-commerce web store

'eStore' is the final project I've created during an intensive 3-month bootcamp at Ironhack.

This project functions as intended. Although, it continues to be a **work in progress**.

## Overview

This is a fullstack React app.

### My idea

This is an app that mimics an E-commerce web store using an API. 

### What can a user do?

-   Auth: Signup & Login
-   Browse an e-commerce store with items from an API
-   Add, edit, and remove items from your cart
-   Upload a photo to your profile
-   Input wishlist items on your profile

## Built with

-   CSS
-   React
-   Redux
-   React Google API
-   Socket.io
-   Webpack
-   PostgreSQL

## Getting Started

```Console
npm install
```

use 
```Console
npm start
```
On the client, and then **once again to start the server**.
