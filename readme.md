# E-commerce web store

'eStore' is the final project I've created during an intensive 3-month bootcamp at Ironhack.

This project functions as intended. Although, it continues to be a **work in progress**.

## Overview

This is a fullstack React app.

### My idea

A React based web application that mimics an E-commerce web store using an API. 

### What can a user do?

-   Auth: Signup & Login
-   Browse an e-commerce store with items from an API
-   Add, edit, and remove items from your cart
-   Upload a photo to your profile
-   Input wishlist items on your profile

## Built with

-   React
-   HMTL/CSS
-   Javascript
-   Commerce.js API
-   Node.js
-   Mongoose
-   Express
-   JWT
-   Cloudinary
-   Axios
-   MUI


## Getting Started

-   This project has a server (root dir) and a client (client dir). 
-   For local dev, run these commands in each of them.

```Console
npm install
```

 
```Console
npm start
```
